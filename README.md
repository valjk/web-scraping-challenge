# web-scraping-challenge
I really enjoyed this challenge and leveraged class files to help guide me through the solutions. Being able to apply these concepts by performing an analysis of the Curiosity Rover's finding on Mars by webscraping, plotting graphs using Pandas and writing down my findings, felt like a real-world application of what I learned throuhgout this module and past modules.
